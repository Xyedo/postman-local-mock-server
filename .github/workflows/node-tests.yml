# Description: This GitHub Actions workflow automates Node.js CI/CD for a Node.js project.
# It performs the following steps:

# Step 1: Check out the source code.
# Step 2: Set up different versions of Node.js for testing.
# Step 3: Perform a clean install of Node.js dependencies.
# Step 4: Cache and restore dependencies for faster builds.
# Step 5: Build the source code.
# Step 6: Run tests using different versions of Node.js.

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Step 1: Check out the source code from the repository.

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm' # Step 2: Use npm caching for faster dependency installs.

    - name: Install Node.js dependencies
      run: npm ci # Step 3: Perform a clean install of Node.js dependencies.

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test # Step 4: Run tests using the specified Node.js version.
